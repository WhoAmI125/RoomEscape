# Room Escape Game

###### Made by OSS Team 6: HyunJoon Park, Hajong Kim, Yumin Heo

Our project "Escape Room" tried to solve the problem that learning new lessons can be boring by interacting questions about HTML, Git, and JavaScript with Room Escape. Our project offers visual entertainment that attracts users and provides entertainment while solving the questions.

The web page provides several different questions inside the room. The user can only open the exit and escape the room by solving all problems and obtaining hints by solving the questions.

**Features:**

There is a main room, and several rooms which can be accessed by solving problems. Each room provides several different questions. Questions are provided with visual contents.  The user has to know the features of HTML, Git and JavaScript to find the answer. If the user finds all the answers and solves the questions, the user can will receive hint to unlock the door and escape the room. It is a success when the user escapes every room.

**Usage scenario:**  

1.  The index.html will be the main room that will start. There would be pop-up explain about the stoy

2.  In the room, there will be objects that can be clicked and solve the questions to receive the hint. 

3.  The hints received by solving the questions will be used to unlock the door and leave to the next room.

**Task assignment:**

1.  Designing rooms

2.  Making overall plot

3.  Making problem & answer sets using what we learned in class

4.  Making rooms and user-interfaces by HTML & CSS

5.  Making detailed parts (ex. scene of enlarged objects)
